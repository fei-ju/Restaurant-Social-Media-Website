# CSC309 Final Project: Restify

## Notes for running:
* Open VM and run `source startup.sh` followed by `./run.sh` to run frontend and backend servers.
* To stop both servers from running, run `./stop.sh`

## Additional Notes
* Ensure that port forwarding is enabled when running the startup and run scripts
* This can be done by running `ssh csc309@<VM IP> -L 127.0.0.1:8000:127.0.0.1:8000`
